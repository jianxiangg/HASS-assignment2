Done by: Gian Jian Xiang (1005684)

Pre-processing

1. Data file (.csv) was downloaded from data.gov.sg
2. An R script was written for data manipulation (i.e. filter relevant information, and convert format from long to wide).
3. Output file from R script is then used for visualization.

Visualization

1. Stacked area chart was chosen to display the total persons arrested per offence across the years. Only data of the "21 years and above" group was visualized.
2. A tooltip to simultaneously display all values per year (depending on cursor hover) was created.
3. Some observations of the chart were then described below.
